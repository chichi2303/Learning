                It is one of the best album in my opinion. All the songs, even the ballad ones are really nice. Their voices got better in this album and this album is one of the reasons they became top group in Korea.

                I personally like "Run Devil Run" song more than any song. It is strong and catchy. Beside, they looked really energetic.

                Their first move to US market. It created a big hit back then and everyone loved it. The visual was well done and the songs are really good.
