            <li>Place the beef knuckle in a very large <b>(9 quart or more)</b> pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with <b>2 gallons of water</b>. Bring to a boil, and cook for about <b>2 hours</b>.</li>
            
            <li> Skim fat from the surface of the soup, and add the oxtail, radish and onions. Tie the anise pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, peppercorns and ginger in a cheesecloth or place in a spice bag; add to the soup. Stir in sugar, salt and fish sauce. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least <b> 4 more hours (the longer, the betterr)</b>. At the end of cooking, taste, and add salt as needed. Strain broth, and return to the pot to keep at a simmer. Discard spices and bones. Reserve meat from the beef knuckle for other uses if desired.</li>
            
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Soak the rice noodles in water for <b>about 20 minutes</b>, then cook in boiling water until soft, but not mushy,<b> about 5 minutes</b>. Slice the frozen beef paper thin.

            <li>Place some noodles into each bowl, and top with a few raw beef slices. Ladle boiling broth over the beef and noodles in the bowl.
